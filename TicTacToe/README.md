# Welcome!
## This TicTacToe game was created with just HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and javascript.

This was my first project in General Assembly's web development immersive course!
I do apologize for all the alert messages, they can get annoying but I invite you to play and let me know if you have any suggestions on how to improve the project.

Winners are stored with local storage, and if you are checking out the code you may notice that the function that determines a winner is a bit verbose.  Let me know how I might refactor if you want and thanks for visiting!
