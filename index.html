					<h1>Welcome to Brett Wilson's Homepage</h1>
					<h2> - Aspiring Web Developer - </h2>
					<p>I have a background in finance and an MBA from USM - Portland but am trying to make the transition to development. I recently worked at the VIA Agency, a nationally recognized advertising agency, for four years as a financial analyst in Portland Maine. I am an active person who likes the outdoors. Running, biking, skiing, and hiking are my favorite activities as well as simply going to the Maine beaches in the summer.</p><br />
					<p>Here are some links to pages I recently made in GA's HTML and CSS circuit!</p>
