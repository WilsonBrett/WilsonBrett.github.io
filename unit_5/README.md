###Graise
##General Assembly unit project

I designed this site from input gathered from a classmate who played the role of the client.

It was for a fake company that would be selling grains for farm animals.

I had to review competitor website designs and quickly realized that many of these sites were outdated.

Using HTML and CSS only I built an MVP for this potential client.
